Fenriz: Utility bot for irssi with last.fm support.

Copy these scripts into your irssi scripts directory (typically ~/.irssi/scripts)

If you need help loading scripts you may want to consider a different irc client.

To autoload these scripts, create an autorun dir in the scripts directory.  you can use symlinks.

ln -s ~/.irssi/scripts/lastfm.pl ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/

Something along those lines should do the trick. 

You can catch me in #metal on snoonet if you have any questions.

To get a feel for what the Bot can do you can use the ~help command.
