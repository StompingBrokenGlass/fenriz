Fenriz: Utility bot for irssi with last.fm support.

Installation
======

1. Git pull this repository into your home directory (~)
2. Navigate to your scripts file under your irssi configuration location (usually ~/.irssi)
3. Create a symbolic link to fenriz.pl (ln -s ~/fenriz/fenriz.pl .)
4. Load fenriz.pl in irssi (/script load fenriz.pl)
5. You're done, you can also create a symlink in your autorun directory. 


Notes
======
This is a work in progress and can occasionally be buggy.  
You can find me (kwamaking) on irc.snoonet.com if you have questions.

Issue the ~help command to see a list of commands available for this bot. 

I would GREATLY appreciate it if you used your own last.fm and bit.ly api keys.
